# Winona UI

Welcome to Winona UI â€“ the versatile UI Component Library designed to make your development process seamless across major front-end frameworks like Angular, React, and Vue. 

## Why "Winona"?

The name Winona reflects our core philosophy: 

### *"If it runs on Windows, it will run on anything."* 

We acknowledge that the choice of operating system for web development is a matter of personal or organizational preference. We are not here to debate the merits of Windows versus other operating systems. Instead, we recognize the reality that a significant number of developers use Windows, and these developers often face compatibility issues when contributing to open-source projects that are predominantly developed and optimized for macOS.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to provide a robust and reliable UI component library that works seamlessly on Windows, thereby reducing the friction for Windows users in the open-source community. Winona UI is here to bridge that gap, ensuring that you can focus on building great applications without worrying about cross-platform issues.

## Features

- **Cross-Framework Support:** Winona UI components shall be available for Angular, React, and Vue.
- **Open Source:** Completely open-source, encouraging community contributions and collaboration.
- **Windows Friendly:** Developed and tested extensively on Windows to ensure maximum compatibility.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from everyone. Whether you're using Windows, macOS, or Linux, your input and collaboration are valuable to us. Please refer to our CONTRIBUTING.md file for guidelines on how to get started.
